# Stop user registration 

For some reason, you may want to temporarily disable new user registrations from kthcloud. This is how it was done last time it was needed.

### 1. Log into the kthcloud iam https://iam.cloud.cbh.kth.se/ admin panel

### 2. Visit the identity provider section, and click on the Login with KTH option

### 3. Scroll down to Advanced settings, First login flow override, and select the `deny new users` flow.

### Restore user registration functionality
The default `first broker login` flow should be used when you want to allow new users to register again.

### Editing flows 
The flows can be edited in keycloak admin panel's `Authentication` tab.


## Announcing the registration pause
Please alert users of the change by posting a message on kthcloud's Mastodon and Bluesky accounts, as well as creating an alert on https://github.com/kthcloud/alert
