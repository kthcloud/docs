## GPU Leasing
Leasing GPUs allows you to attach them to your VM, and run tasks that require GPU acceleration.

## The leasing model
Leasing works like a library, where you might reserve a book even when it's not available, and then keep it for your loan period or until someone else requests it, whichever is longest.

### Your leases
You can view your leases on the GPU page, accessible at `/gpu`, by clicking `GPU Leases` in the top menu or on the Deploy page. 

If your lease is already active, it will appear like following. Here you can disable it, or attach it to a VM if you haven't already.

### Available types
There are different models of GPUs available, from different NVIDIA generations. These might need different drivers, and will have different capabilities. Look up which model fits your needs best, and request it.
