# Welcome to kthcloud\!

<b>kthcloud</b> is a student-run cloud provider that offers a free and
open-source alternative to commercial cloud services. 

Our project is proudly supported by a diverse group of partners, financial
 backing is provided by KTH CBH, the EU Erasmus+ program and the KTH Digitalisation Platform. 
 We also receive invaluable computational support from KTH PDC via CoS

The project was kickstarted by the thesis "Designing and implementing a
private cloud for student and faculty software projects" by Pierre Le
Fevre and Emil Karlsson in 2022. You can find the thesis
